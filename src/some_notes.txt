What we want to do is take the content of an xml file and convert it into a directed acyclic graph
For now we want to focus on the flow of the text, meaning: add's and del's and subst. Later on Sic and cor and choice?
We want to create a uniform array of items out of the text centric xml file.
We do this in two steps
First we do a depth first traversal... this gives us an array of xml elements and text items.
Second we group the a tag a body of textual content and a tail together.
This gives uniform items in the array.
Then we want to group all the add and dels if they belong to the same subst
To accomplish that we would need to keep track of the parent element when creating the xml blocks
